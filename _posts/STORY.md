**Social**

I want to be able to use the app to find and add your friends just like email.

For example, if Alice and Bob met at a party, and Bob wanted to add Alice as a social friend, he would simply search the app for the ID Alice told him about, which would be in the same format as an email, like alice@halfmemories.com, and then Bob would type that ID into the search box and follow Alice, Alice would get a notification and follow Bob back, and they would become friends.

(As long as Alice is using an application that supports ActivityPub, Bob will be able to find her.)

**Instant Messaging**

When Alice wants to send an instant message to Bob, she finds Bob in her friends list and sends the message. Bob can still receive messages from Alice even if he is logged in from another [matrxi.org](http://matrxi.org) client.

(In hvxahv's design, the user simply clicks to turn on instant messaging, which opens an [matrix](http://matrix.org) account. Although the matrix ID format is #name:matrix.disism.com, hvxahv integrates with it, so it's easier for the user to initiate communication with others through the buddy list when using hvxahv, rather than having to find and add them manually.)

**Channel: Information delivery medium, news, radio**

Alice loves cats, and it just so happens that someone has created a channel in another instance of hvxahv that posts pictures of cats every day, and the channel is called neko@h.disism.com. See the content posted by the channel.

(Freedom of Press-Speech, everyone can send what you want to the world by creating your own channel, the channel saves the data in IPFS, and the content posted will not be deleted. (Please learn about IPFS.)

**Personal Storage**

Alice downloaded a picture of a cat, a picture she wanted to store in the cloud, but it just so happened that she was using a cloud storage system that was full of space, she opened the hvxahv application, clicked saved, and uploaded the picture.

(This storage feature will use IPFS for storage, the file will not be able to be changed or deleted, and file encryption needs to be implemented to protect sensitive data.)
